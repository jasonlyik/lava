Original paper has simulator as backend for TENNLab framework

Functions for interacting with TENNLab interface:
- Load network: creating appropriate neurons and synapses and connecting them together, creation of any monitor structures
- Apply spikes: create appropriate spike generators or spikes from TENNLab spike representation
- Run: perform simulation on the loaded network and input spikes
- Output count / output last fire / output vector: return info about output spikes or network or particular neuron. return count of spikes, time of last spike, or vector containing times of all spikes
- Clear activity: current network remain loaded, but reset network to its initial state
- Clear: removes network and associated activity from simulator

TODO:
- figure out how to make recurrent connections in same process (need for random, shortest path)
--> define recurrent connections via LIF1 -> Dense -> LIF1
- read how to connect dataset/spiking input into the sim
